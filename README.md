SecureShare is a powerful web application that allows for secure upload and sharing of documents. Our seamless UI integrations allow for a hassle-free document management experience. SecureShare’s scalable infrastructure allows for safe and secure document upload and sharing – with unique features like document verification, certificate generation and password encryption – all in one place.


## Features of SecureShare:<br/>
1) Supporting multiple formats (pdf, zip, txt, image etc.) <br/>
2) Size validation of the document with compression features. <br/>
3) Provides proper error message if document is not uploaded properly <br/>
4) Upload any file to the server and receive a certificate to securely offer the certificate to multiple users. <br/>
