SecureShare is a powerful web application that allows for secure upload and sharing of documents. Our seamless UI integrations allow for a hassle-free document management experience. SecureShare’s scalable infrastructure allows for safe and secure document upload and sharing – with unique features like document verification, certificate generation and password encryption – all in one place.

## Working of SecureShare
A user/organization can easily register to create an account on SecureShare. The user can upload a document at the ‘Upload Files’ tab which can be optionally password protected. After uploading, a unique certificate of a minimal size of 1KB is generated which can be uploaded elsewhere on third party applications to provide access to the secured document.<br/>
The user also has the option to ‘Verify Files’ which informs the user whether or not the document was modified by an external source. The tool is useful to verify the authenticity of a document.<br/>
Fetching a document in SecureShare is simple too. If the document is uploaded as a password protected one, then the other end needs the password, this is an optional high security feature otherwise, in case of application forms, when the document is shared in encrypted format in the form, and in the receiving end an authorized user can just fetch the document locally, without any password required.<br/>


## Features of SecureShare:<br/>
1) Supporting multiple formats (pdf, zip, txt, image etc.) <br/>
2) Size validation of the document with compression features. <br/>
3) Provides proper error message if document is not uploaded properly <br/>
4) Upload any file to the server and receive a certificate to securely offer the certificate to multiple users. <br/>
5) Analytics-based dashboard for user to understand how many files of a file type are there. <br/>
6) Scanning feature for mobile phones integrated on our application
7) Verification at both ends if document is modified in any way or not. <br/>
8) Integration with other web applications easily. <br/>
